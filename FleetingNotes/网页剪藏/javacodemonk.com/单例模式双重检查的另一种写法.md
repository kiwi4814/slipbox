Optimization Algorithm:

1. Check that the variable is initialized without obtaining the lock. If it is initialized, return it immediately.
2. Obtain the lock
3. Double-check whether the variable has already been initialized, if the another thread acquired the lock first, it may have already done the initialization. If so, return the initialized variable.
4. Otherwise, initialize and return the variable.

Optimized version of thread-safe Singleton version using locking:

/src/main/java/Foo.java Optimized version

```java
class Foo {
    private volatile Helper helper;

    public Helper getHelper() {
        Helper localRef = helper;
        if (localRef == null) {     // ①
            synchronized (this) {
                localRef = helper;  // ②
                if (localRef == null) {
                    helper = localRef = new Helper();
                }
            }
        }
        return localRef;    // ③
    }
    // other functions and members...
}
```

| ①    | Using , we are reducing the access of volatile variable to just one for positive usecase. If we do not use localRef, then we would have to access volatile variable twice - once for checking null and then at method return time. Accessing volatile memory is quite an expensive affair because it involves reaching out to main memory.`localRef` |
| ---- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| ②    | Refreshing local reference to latest value after acquiring a lock, since volatile variable may have changed by this time due. |
| ③    | volatile variable is accessed at method return time.         |

The volatile keyword ensures that multiple threads handle the singleton instance correctly.
